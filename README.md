NFURLConnection
===============

NFURLConnection - basic framework for sending network requests and parsing responses

NFURLConnection has a similar architecture to NSURLConnection, but with extra features:
* an NSOperationQueue to control concurrent network requests, set up dependencies, and priorities etc.
* constructs query part of url request from given parameters
* automatically decode XML and JSON responses.
* automatically encode parameters to a JSON body when sending a non-GET request with a JSON content type.
* ability to construct multipart form body (including binary data) for POST requests
* network responses are tied to the original request, so calling code can easily work with multiple concurrent requests.

External requirements:

* json-framework

Installation
------------

    > git clone git://github.com/NextFaze/NFURLConnction.git
    > cd NFURLConnction
    > git submodule init
    > git submodule update

NFURLConnction is a Cocoa Touch Static Library project, and can be incorporated into other xcode projects in the usual ways.

Notes:
- ensure NFURLConnection is added as Target Dependency
- ensure libNFURLSConnection.a is added to Link Binary With Libraries
- in Build Settings, Other Linker Flags, add: -all_load

Synopsis
--------

    // optionally: define an enumeration of request types
    typedef enum {
       RequestType1,    
       RequestType2,
       RequestType2
    } RequestType;

    // create a url connection:
    NFURLConnection *conn = [[NFURLConnection alloc] init];
    conn.delegate = self;   // optional
    
    // create a request
    NFURLRequest *req = [[[NFURLRequest alloc] init] autorelease];
    req.URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.google.com/"];
    req.HTTPMethod = @"GET"; 
    req.requestType = RequestType1;   // optionally assign a request type
    [req setParameterValue:@"foo" forKey:@"bar"];  // optionally assign parameters

    // send a request asynchronously
    [conn sendRequest:req];

    // send a request synchronously
    NFURLResponse *response = [conn sendSynchronousRequest:req];
    
    // accessing data structures from the response
    id data = response.object;   // NSArray or NSDictionary if response body is json or xml

    // differentiating responses based on the request
    // the response object contains a reference to the request:
    NSLog(@"request type is: %d", response.request.requestType);

When using a delegate and asynchronous requests, implement the NFURLConnectionDelegate protocol:

    // delegate method
    - (void)NFURLConnection:(NFURLConnection *)connection requestCompleted:(NFURLRequest *)request {
        NFURLResponse *response = request.response;
        
        ...
    }

Network Queue
-------------

The queue property of NFURLConnection is a NSOperationQueue, and can be accessed to modify the number of concurrent network operations sent by the connection (when sending asynchronous requests).  Each NFURLRequest is a NSOperation, and dependencies can be set up between them in the normal way.
